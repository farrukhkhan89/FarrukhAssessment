There is the application solution : 

Clone the repo 
Build it 
Place the JSON file in the location mentioned in code

Note:
I really had a very tight schedule and could spend really less time on the application , hard coded the date filter part.

Just go to https://localhost:44360/Practitioner/PractitionerList
